#Design Process


*These are my process notes for developing my portfolio.*

----------- 




##Goals
*Project Management*: Design my portfolio in 1 week.

*User focused*: A recruiter can quickly & enjoyably learn about my professional work.
    


*future user goals* 
2. A user interested can spend lots of time learning about my design process.

3. A designer or coder can immediately understand the value of the way I presented the essence of my work/personal brand.
