#Design Process


*These are my process notes for developing my portfolio.*

----------- 




##Goals
*Project Management*: Design my portfolio in 1 week.

*User focused*: A recruiter can quickly & enjoyably learn about my professional work.
    


*future user goals* 
2. A user interested can spend lots of time learning about my design process.

3. A designer or coder can immediately understand the value of the way I presented the essence of my work/personal brand.

##Schedule

* **Tuesday** *2h* [goals, audiences,  content]
* **Wednesday** *2h* [design wireframe]
* **Thursday** *2h* [wireframe, write about me's]
* **Friday** *2h* [step back:grid analysis, code wireframe]
* **Saturday** *8h* [code new wireframe, brand analysis, visual design, cleanup design, refactor code, interaction]


##Most Important Content

* I show my work or experience 
* the process of creation is communicated
* about me (personal brand) 
* social connect

which leads to... features

##Features
