    <h1> Dylan Boudro</h1>
        <p>Hi!  I'm Dylan and the best way to describe myself is this.
            my two schools, align with my two passions, which align with my two professions.  At Bard college, I studied human consciousness via psychology, buddhism, and meditation.  I use my knowledge from these fields  to be an empathetic designer.  
            Now, at NEU, I'm learning how to utilize design thinking and FED by studying CS & Digital art.  I use my knowledge from my dual major to materialize concepts into solutions that solve user pain.
